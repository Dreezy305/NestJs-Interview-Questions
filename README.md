### 1. What is Nestjs

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

# Disclaimer

The primary purpose of setting up this project is for you to get an insight into how nestjs questions might be structured. This doesn't neccessarily represent the nature of nestjs interviews across various companies and neither is it a standard that represents nestjs questions.

Goodluck in your interview :blush:
